Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The key principles include:

- **Supervised Learning**: Training on labeled data to make predictions
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback

The process typically involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.`,
