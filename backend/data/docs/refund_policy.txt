Refund Policy (Important but Slightly Funny)

Refunds are available within 30 days if the product is unused, unchewed, and has not been turned into modern art.
To request a refund, simply send us an email and a picture of the product proving it still looks normal.

We aim to process all refunds within 7 business days.
Returning an empty box does not count as a valid return, no matter how convincing your sad story is.
